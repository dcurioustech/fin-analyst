# Financial Analysis Assistant - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Transform the existing financial analysis bot into an intelligent, conversational financial assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide comprehensive financial analysis, company comparisons, and market insights through natural language interactions.

### Current State
- Modular Python application with clean architecture
- Uses yfinance for financial data retrieval
- Provides company profiles, financial metrics, and comprehensive peer comparison
- Separated into services, analysis, UI, utilities, and configuration modules
- Text-based visualizations and data formatting

### Target State
- LLM-powered conversational interface supporting multi-turn conversations
- Natural language query processing for complex financial analysis
- Production-ready deployment on Google Cloud Platform
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple data sources and analysis types
