# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements basic LangGraph integration to transform the existing menu-driven financial analysis bot into a conversational AI assistant. The integration provides natural language query processing while maintaining all existing analysis capabilities through a new conversational interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the financial analysis system using natural language queries, so that I can get financial insights through conversation instead of navigating menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "Analyze Apple" THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive financial analysis for Apple (AAPL)
2. WHEN I use company names like "Tesla" or "Microsoft" THEN the system SHALL correctly map them to ticker symbols
3. WHEN I use ticker symbols like "AAPL" or "MSFT" THEN the system SHALL recognize and process them correctly
4. WHEN I ask for specific analysis types THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate analysis function

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain conversation context, so that I can ask follow-up questions without repeating information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze a company THEN the system SHALL remember the company in conversation context
2. WHEN I ask "How does it compare to Microsoft?" after analyzing Apple THEN the system SHALL understand "it" refers to Apple
3. WHEN I have multiple companies in context THEN the system SHALL maintain all companies for subsequent queries
4. WHEN I start a new conversation THEN the system SHALL reset the context appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LangGraph tools that wrap existing analysis functions, so that the conversational AI can access all current financial analysis capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LangGraph agent needs company information THEN it SHALL use tools that wrap the existing FinancialDataService
2. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the agent SHALL use tools that wrap existing analyzer classes
3. WHEN tools are executed THEN they SHALL return structured data compatible with both LangGraph and existing formatters
4. WHEN errors occur in tools THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent routing of my requests, so that the system automatically determines what type of analysis I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mention keywords like "profile" or "company info" THEN the system SHALL route to company profile analysis
2. WHEN I mention "compare" or "vs" THEN the system SHALL route to comparison analysis
3. WHEN I mention "metrics" or "ratios" THEN the system SHALL route to financial metrics analysis
4. WHEN I mention specific statements like "income" or "balance sheet" THEN the system SHALL route to statement analysis
5. WHEN no specific analysis is mentioned THEN the system SHALL default to appropriate analysis based on context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple chat interface to interact with the LangGraph-powered system, so that I can test and use the conversational capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and instructions
2. WHEN I type natural language queries THEN the system SHALL process them and provide formatted responses
3. WHEN I type "help" THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions and examples
4. WHEN I type "exit" or similar commands THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate the session
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper state management for conversations, so that the system can handle complex multi-turn interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a clean state
2. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL update state with parsed information
3. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL store results in state for potential reuse
4. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL use state information to provide contextual answers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle ambiguous or unclear requests gracefully, so that I receive helpful guidance when my query is not understood.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide input without specifying a company THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification
2. WHEN I use unclear language THEN the system SHALL request more specific information
3. WHEN the system cannot parse my request THEN it SHALL provide examples of valid queries
4. WHEN I provide invalid ticker symbols THEN the system SHALL inform me and suggest corrections

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LangGraph integration to be modular and extensible, so that I can easily add new analysis types and capabilities in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new analysis tools are needed THEN they SHALL be easily added to the tools module
2. WHEN new conversation flows are required THEN they SHALL be implementable as new nodes
3. WHEN the graph structure needs modification THEN it SHALL be configurable without breaking existing functionality
4. WHEN new state fields are needed THEN they SHALL be addable to the state schema without breaking compatibility
