# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modularizing the existing `analysis_bot.py` file to create a clean, maintainable codebase that separates concerns and prepares the foundation for future enhancements. The current monolithic script contains all functionality in a single file, making it difficult to test, maintain, and extend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the financial analysis functionality separated into logical modules, so that I can easily maintain and extend the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is modularized THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
2. WHEN a user runs the modularized application THEN the system SHALL provide the same user interface and experience as the original
3. WHEN the modules are created THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions separated into their own module, so that they can be reused across different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are extracted THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated utilities module
2. WHEN formatting functions are moved THEN they SHALL be accessible from other modules
3. WHEN text-based visualization functions are extracted THEN they SHALL maintain their current behavior
4. WHEN the utilities module is created THEN it SHALL include functions for number formatting and text-based charts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want financial data access separated into a dedicated service layer, so that I can easily swap data providers or add caching in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data access is modularized THEN the system SHALL create a financial data service module
2. WHEN yfinance interactions are abstracted THEN they SHALL be contained within the data service layer
3. WHEN the data service is implemented THEN it SHALL provide methods for fetching company info, financial statements, and recommendations
4. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the service SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want analysis functions separated into dedicated modules, so that each type of analysis can be developed and tested independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis functions are modularized THEN the system SHALL create separate modules for different analysis types
2. WHEN company profile analysis is extracted THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated company analysis module
3. WHEN financial metrics analysis is extracted THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated metrics analysis module
4. WHEN peer comparison functionality is extracted THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated comparison analysis module
5. WHEN financial statement display is extracted THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated statement analysis module

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user interface logic separated from business logic, so that I can easily modify the interface without affecting core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is modularized THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated interface module
2. WHEN menu handling is extracted THEN it SHALL be separated from analysis logic
3. WHEN user input processing is modularized THEN it SHALL handle validation and routing to appropriate analysis functions
4. WHEN the main application loop is refactored THEN it SHALL orchestrate the interaction between UI and analysis modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear project structure with organized directories, so that the codebase is easy to navigate and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL create logical directory structure for different module types
2. WHEN modules are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by functionality (services, analysis, ui, utils)
3. WHEN the main application file is created THEN it SHALL serve as the entry point and orchestrate other modules
4. WHEN the structure is complete THEN it SHALL follow Python packaging best practices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the modularized codebase, so that issues can be easily diagnosed and debugged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL implement appropriate error handling
2. WHEN errors occur in data fetching THEN they SHALL be logged and handled gracefully
3. WHEN analysis functions encounter issues THEN they SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize logging configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the modularized code to be easily testable, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL be designed with testability in mind
2. WHEN functions are extracted THEN they SHALL have clear inputs and outputs suitable for unit testing
3. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be easily mockable for testing
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL support adding unit tests for each module
